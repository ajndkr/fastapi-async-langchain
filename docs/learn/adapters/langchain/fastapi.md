Lanarky is built on top of FastAPI and offers backwards compatibility with all FastAPI features.
Nonetheless, if your project uses FastAPI and Lanarky is not a drop-in replacement, you can still
the low-level Lanarky modules to build your microservice.

We will use the examples from the [LangChain API Router](./router.md) guide to demonstrate how to
use the low-level modules as well as understand how the router works under the hood.

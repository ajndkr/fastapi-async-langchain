FastAPI offers a powerful [Dependency Injection](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/)
system that allows you to inject dependencies into your API endpoints. Lanarky extends this functionality
by offering LangChain as a dependency.

    LLM-based dependency injection is an experimental feature. We will add more functionality
    based on community feedback and viable use cases. If you have ideas or suggestions, we
    would love to hear from you. Feel free to open an issue on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/ajndkr/lanarky/issues/new/choose).

Let's take a look at how we can use LangChain as a dependency.

A `FastAPI <https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi>`_ framework to build production-grade LLM applications.

‚ùì Why?
-----------------

Many open-source projects for developing and deploying LLM applications have either opinionated designs,
particularly regarding deployment, or limitations in terms of scalability. This is where Lanarky comes in.
Lanarky is an open-source project that provides Python users with an unopinionated web framework for constructing
and deploying LLM applications. By leveraging FastAPI as its foundation, Lanarky ensures that applications built
with it are production-ready and can be seamlessly deployed on any cloud provider.

üíæ Installation
-----------------

The library is available on PyPI and can be installed via ``pip``.

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install lanarky
